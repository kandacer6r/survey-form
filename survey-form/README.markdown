# Survey form

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/kandacer6r/pen/mdpxNNv](https://codepen.io/kandacer6r/pen/mdpxNNv).

For this project, I created a fun little survey. The purpose of this project is to reinforce my knowledge of HTML and CSS. This project uses CSS and HTML. I used HTML to create the plain text and input values. CSS is what I used to create the aesthetic look. Currently, this survey prompts the user for their name, a proper email, and to choose their age (hardcoded min 10, max 100). The rest of the survey can be left blank and be interacted with but neither will affect the submission of the survey. Currently, the survey information isn't being saved anywhere and is just for aesthetic purposes right now. 

The orginal code can be seen using the top link. Enjoy!
